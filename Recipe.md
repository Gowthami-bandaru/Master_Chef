Make marinated tomatoes: 
In a medium skillet over medium-low heat, heat oil. 
Add garlic and cook until lightly golden, 2 to 4 minutes, then remove from heat and let it cool.
In a large bowl, toss together tomatoes, basil, vinegar, salt, and red pepper flakes. 
Add garlic and oil from skillet and toss to combine. 
Let marinate for at least 30 minutes.
Meanwhile, toast bread
Brush bread on both sides lightly with oil and place on large baking sheet. Toast bread until golden, 10 to 15 minutes, turning halfway through. Let bread cool for 5 minutes, then rub tops of bread with halved garlic cloves.
Spoon tomatoes on top of bread just before serving.
